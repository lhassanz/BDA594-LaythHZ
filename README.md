**BIG DATA** *Definition: * In my own words, I would say that the definition of *Big Data* is a large collection of carrying and valuable data from certain sources to be utilized in some degree or fashion. It is known that our current software may be unable to handle the large quanties of data out there, but we pursue this goal none the less.
